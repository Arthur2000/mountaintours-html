        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p><em>
        Hi, I am Arthur!<br>
        I’m Ukrainian, i’ve lived here all my days and back in 2016 I quit my desk job to be outside more. Simple (Not really). I love to run
         and hike in the Scottish Highlands and above all else, love everything Scotland. From the ancient history of our bloody past to the
          beautiful spirit that we have become quite well known for (not Gin). I wanted to find a way to explore more while still bringing home
           the bread and so now I give personal tour experiences of any kind to anyone traveling here. I’m different from your typical guide, I’m
            a bit quirky and I truly care that you leave feeling a genuine connection to this place I call home.
